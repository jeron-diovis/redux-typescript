 *
 * "referrer" is applied when user successfully opened a page,
 * after any potential redirects (and omitting REPLACE'd locations).
 *
 * "prev location" is like "live" value â€“ it's exactly previous location,
 * including changes done by redirects, regardless of PUSH/REPLACE actions.
 *
 * For most cases, you want to use referrer.
 * `usePrevLocation` is utility for components like "ProtectedRoute".
